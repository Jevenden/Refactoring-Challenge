# Refactoring-Challenge

Other than one broken link in the navbar, the code was essentially functional, if cumbersome. The lion's share of my work on the project consisted of adding semantic HTML elements in a logical structure (and thus removing a number of unnecessary class elements in the accompanying CSS stylesheet), increasing accessability through alt img attributes and a descriptive title, and compiling repetitive code in the aforementioned stylesheet, along with adding a number of comments to both sheets to increase clarity and ease of access.
